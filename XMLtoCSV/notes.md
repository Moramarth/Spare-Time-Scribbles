# reading XML and writing into new CSV file

A simple script I made for a friend. This is in no case true XML file converter just something
to automate and speed up a working chore. Script reads files with specific properties and outputs them in a certain form that is
requested by my friend. 

Can need some refactoring after it is fully tested on the original dataset.
